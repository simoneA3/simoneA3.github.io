A little bit about me, I am from Germantown, MD and have pretty much lived there my whole life. I went to Northwest Highschool and my school actually had a decent computer science program which influenced my decision to pick SWEN as my major. I took 4 different computer science courses including AP CS A and AP Computer Science Principles. I enjoy watching movies and TV a lot and am currently rewatching Bojack Horseman. I also am a really big music fan and like all genres. I usually listen to R&B, Rap/Hip-Hop and Pop the most. I don't necessarily have a favorite artist but I am a big Beyonce fan. Recently I've been getting into going to the gym and going on runs. I ran track for a year in Highschool and enjoy running overall so going to the gym is a good hobby to get me out the dorm.
