A little bit about me, I am from Germantown, MD and have pretty much lived there my whole life. I went to Northwest Highschool and my school actually had a decent computer science program which influenced my decision to pick SWEN as my major. I took 4 different computer science courses including AP CS A and AP Computer Science Principles. I enjoy watching movies and TV a lot and am currently rewatching Bojack Horseman. I also am a really big music fan and like all genres. I usually listen to R&B, Rap/Hip-Hop and Pop the most. I don't necessarily have a favorite artist but I am a big Beyonce fan. Recently I've been getting into going to the gym and going on runs. I ran track for a year in Highschool and enjoy running overall so going to the gym is a good hobby to get me out the dorm.

A few things I'm looking forward to in this class:

Learning the processes that real software engineers use to manage their work and projects
Working on my project with my group
The student panel
How work effeciently and provide deliverables on time
